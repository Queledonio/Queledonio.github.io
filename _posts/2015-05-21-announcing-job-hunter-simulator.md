JOB HUNTING SIMULATOR is a game about doing everything in your power to land a job.

You play as your unemployed self, starting with a single available option: to send unsolicited CV’s. Doing so generates JOB HUNTING SIMULATOR’s prime resource: **desperation**. massing and investing desperation will open new doors in your path to become the ultimate job hunter:

* **Unlock** new actions and upgrades, including opening a LinkedOut account, harassing your friends into sponsoring you and attaching a cover letter with every CV you send.

* **Automate** your job hunting with the help of recruiters, a personal website with curated SEO and an army of Twiddler bots and Goggles Alerts searching for job offers by keyword.
* **Discover** a myriad of random networking and life events packed with thrilling opportunities, unexpected twists and reality checks to bring you closer to –or farther from–  a job interview.

**FEATURES:**

* **Feel Unemployed:** Endure the journey using the *Rock Bottom* boost and developing passive abilities like *Decreasing Market Value*.  
* **Entry-level gameplay:** All you need is click.

* **Play while you’re Looking for a Job:** JOB HUNTING SIMULATOR is a browser game you can play at your own pace.  
 
JOB HUNTING SIMULATOR is coming to desktop browsers soon. Unless I get a job.
